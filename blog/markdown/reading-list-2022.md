The Viking Wars

January 29, 2022

Max Adams, *The Viking Wars, War and Peace in King Alfred's Britain, 789-955*, (New York, 2018). An interesting book about this period but makes reference to a lot of archaelogical studies that refer to place names in England, so may be more interesting to someone who lives in England.

looked for a book on early modern Danish history. This is what I found, a book about crusading and conversion to Christianity in the Baltic region. Interesting book covering a subject somewhat overlooked in the history of crusading.
