Beowulf

Seamus Healy, translator, *Beowulf*, (New York, 2000). This is a very readable tranlation of the old English poem Beowulf. It has the original old English beside the translation. It is amazing how much old English it virtually unreadable.

A History of Wales

Jan 6, 2024

Sir John Edward LLoyd, *A History of Wales From the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest, 3rd ed., volume 1*, (London, 1939). My genealogy research has found that I may have some Welsh ancestry. Whenever I search for historical information about Wales the references mostly refer to this book, so I bought it on [AbeBooks](https://www.abebooks.com/) since it seems to be out of print. My experience buying out of print books that are reprints (they seem to be mostly print on demands of Google scans) has not been good so I try to find original copies here. This first volume covers history of Wales up to the Norman conquest of England in 1066. It covers pre-Roman, Roman, and early Welsh history and society.

A History of Wales

Jan 6, 2024

Sir John Edward LLoyd, *A History of Wales From the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest, 2nd ed., volume 2*, (London, 1912). This second volume is a bit harder to follow as it makes reference to many Welsh place names and people, but it does give a good overview of the ruling princes up to the conquest of Wales by Edward I of England.
