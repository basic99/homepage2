The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.

December 30, 2025

Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edited and abridged by David Wormersly*, (London, 1788; abridged, 2001). I had many years ago read a different abrdiged version. This version was different in that it did not abridge each chapter, but included some of the chapters as they were written and some just a brief summary of the others.

Margaret Pole, Counter of Salisbury, 1473-1541.

December 30, 2025

Hazel Pierce, *Margaret Pole, Counter of Salisbury, 1473-1541*, (Cardiff, 2003). During my genealogy research I contacted Hazel Pierce to look for some  reccords in Wales. Afterwards I saw she had written a book, so I read it. I was not familiar with the subject matter, but was interested that Margaret and more importantly her son Reginald were  central figures in politics during the reigh of Henry VIII, and appeared in the historical drama Wolf Hall.

The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence

June 21, 2025

William Henry Hoyt, *The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence.  A Study of Evidence Showing that the Alleged Early Declaration of Independence by Mecklenburg County , North Carolina, on May 20th, 1775 is Spurious*, (New York, 1907). This book studies the evidence that the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was an actual document declaring independence from England. The original was lost by fire and reconstructed years later from memory. Some old newpapers from that time do show a similar resolution but the date is off by 11 days and it does not call for independence but just a suspension of British rule.
