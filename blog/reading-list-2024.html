<p>Charles Spencer, <em>The White Ship, Conquest, Anarchy and the Wrecking of Henry I&#39;s Dream</em>, (London, 2020). The book is a history of England in the early 1100s, especially about the struggle for  royal succession to Henry I caused by the death of his heir in a ship that sank crossing from France to England.</p>

<p>Seeking Sanctuary</p>
<p>March 30, 2024</p>
<p>Shannon McSheffrey, <em>Seeking Sanctuary, Crime, Mercy, and Politics in English Courts, 1400-1550</em>, (Oxford, 2017). My genealogy research has found one of my putative ancestors was involved in a murder. While researching this I found a <a href="https://sanctuaryseekers.ca/2020/05/06/marches/">web page</a> by the author that was about the incident. The book is an interesting and readable story about how sanctuary was for a time an established practice used to escape the harsh penalties of English common law.</p>
