<p>The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence</p>
<p>June 21, 2025</p>
<p>William Henry Hoyt, <em>The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence.  A Study of Evidence Showing that the Alleged Early Declaration of Independence by Mecklenburg County , North Carolina, on May 20th, 1775 is Spurious</em>, (New York, 1907). This book studies the evidence that the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was an actual document declaring independence from England. The original was lost by fire and reconstructed years later from memory. Some old newpapers from that time do show a similar resolution but the date is off by 11 days and it does not call for independence but just a suspension of British rule.</p>
