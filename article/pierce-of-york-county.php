    <h2>Pierce of York County</h2>
    <p>A York County, Virginia, order, dated 26 March 1694, recorded a deed of gift from Frances Cobbs to her son Mathew Peirce. It mentions a gift to him in 1687 and additional items and mentions that the gift shall be given when he is 21. A later court order concerning this gift states that she was the widow of Edmund Cobb and remarried John Steward. The will of Edmund Cobb of York County, Bruton Parish, mentions his son-in-law Matthew Pierce and wife Frances. Edmund had no issue (<a href="/downloads/cobb.pdf">Cobb Or Cobbs Family</a>, William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 19, p. 51-56).

<p>The Virginia quit rent rolls for 1704 show that Matt Pierce owned 100 acres in York County. In 1731 Matthew Pierce was one of the tobacco warehouse inspectors for Williamsburg. He was listed as one of the vestry of Bruton Parish in 1721. The will of Matthew Pierce, either the son or grandson of Frances Cobb, is dated 1737:

<blockquote>Matthew Pierce of Bruton Parish, York Co. 4 Sept. 1737. To my wife on condition she relinquished her right of dower to all my estate all the estate real &amp; personal which she had when I intermarried with her and also all the profits there of which estate &amp; profits is in the hands of Henry Tyler and she may keep my younger dau and have the use of the chamber &amp; shed in my house until she is married or otherwise provided for. I desire Henry Tyler may be paid 50 pounds. I desire my son John Pierce may be paid 103 pounds it being the balance of my grandfather John Steward's estate. I give to my daughter Mitchell a ring of pistole valsue. I give to my dau Marrable a ring of pistole value. I give to my son Matthew Poerce all my lansds and four Negoes, to wit , Matt, Charles, John &amp; Old Aylce, and 1/7 pt of my personal estate. My will is that my youngest children may choose their guardians, and that they be educated and maintained out of the profits of their estate. I desire that all the rest of my estate be divided amongst my six children, to wit, John, Anne, Susanna, Richard, William, &amp; Mildred. I desire my good friends Richard Booker, Robert Goodrich &amp; my son in law Willam Marrable to be directors, assistants, and trustees with my executores. I appoint my sons Matthew Pierce and John Pierce executors. Wit Richard Booker, Robert Goodrich, Thomas Leigh. Proved 20 Mar 1737.</blockquote>

<p>Matthew Pierce, son of above, died in 1755 when his estate was recorded in York County. A son of this Matthew Pierce was <a href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/william-pierce-1753-1789">William Pierce </a>(1753-1789) who was an officer in the Revolutionary War, was member of the Continental Congress for Georgia and attended the Constitutional Convention in 1787.</p>

<p>A court order in York County dated 20 July 1724 says that the inventory of the estate of Rebecca Bee was returned by Matthew Pierce, Joseph Pierce and Robert Crawley [Kathleen Ingram, York County, Virginia, Deeds, Orders, Wills, etc 1722-1725]. This record shows that Joseph Peirce Sr. and Jr. who were in Warwick County records in 1713 were likely members of this presumably unrelated family living in York County.</p>
