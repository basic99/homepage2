    <h2>The White Family of Norfolk County</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this research was to learn more about the life and ancestry of John White who died in Isle of Wight Co., Va., ca. 1729[1]. He was evidently a member of the White family that lived on the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River in Norfolk Co., Va. The records of Lower Norfolk Co. and eighteenth century Norfolk Co. show that there was another White family that originally settled near Curratuck Bay in what was later Princess Anne Co. The records of this family will be covered first mainly for reference, and then the records of the White family of the Elizabeth River will be covered in more detail.
<h4>Patrick, John , and William White</h4>
 <p>Patrick<sup>1</sup>White's first of several land patent entries was for 160 acres in Lower Norfolk Co. on 30 Sept. 1670.[2] The land was on the "west side of the N. River falling into Coratoke." On 21 April 1690 he was granted 1554 acres in Lower Norfolk Co. "on the main bay of Coratuck..., including Crow Island SE from his plantation on Knotts Island."[3] Patrick White died by 5 Oct. 1691 when an inventory of his estate was sworn to by his wife Elizabeth in Princess Anne Co.[4] Elizabeth White's will in Princess Anne Co., dated 5 April 1692, named children Dinah Jones, Elizabeth Swaine, Ruth Whiteall, Solomon, and Patrick.[5] Solomon<sup>2</sup> White's will in Princess Anne Co., dated 27 Sept. 1734, named children Elizabeth, Mary, Isabell, and Solomon.[6]

<p>In the 1704 quit rent roll for Norfolk Co. the only entry for anyone named White was the entry of Patrick<sup>2</sup> White for 500 acres.[7] An inventory of the estate of Patrick<sup>2</sup> White was sworn in Norfolk court on 18 Sept. 1713 by Solomon White.[8] By a deed dated 13 Dec. 1721 Patrick<sup>3</sup> White sold 150 acres in Norfolk Co. to Lawrence Dawley, which land was transferred "to Patrick White, Senr., and by decease of said Patrick White, Senr., fell to above named Patrick White, Jr., by inheritance."[9] In the 1730 Norfolk Co. lists of tithables Patrick<sup>3</sup> White and Patrick<sup>4</sup> White, Jr., were the only people named White living in the county at that time.[10]

<p>By a patent dated 26 Sept. 1674 John<sup>1</sup> White was granted 195 acres in Lower Norfolk Co. in the northern branch of Curratuck by Mr. Basnett's land. The patent was given for transport of 4 persons; i.e. John White, Susan White, John White, Jr., and Solomon White.[11] On 24 May 1680 John White gave James Sherwood 50 acres of land in Lower Norfolk Co. on Basnett's Creek.[12] John White left his will in Lower Norfolk Co., dated 9 Feb. 1680/1. He left "unto my loving Sone in Law James Sherwood all my land." Also mentioned were John Sevell, Mary Sevell, James<sup>3</sup> the son of James Sherwood, and Edward Atwood, Sr. He named James Sherwood his sole executor.[13] By a deed, dated 16 May 1690, James Sherwood and Grace<sup>2</sup> (White) Sherwood sold part of the land "given unto said Sherwood his heirs exc., admr., or assigns by John White, carpenter."[14] Grace (White) Sherwood attained some notoriety as the Virginia Witch. She was examined by the county court and in 1706 her case was heard by the Virginia council.[15] She left a will in Princess Anne Co. dated 20 Aug. 1733.[16]

<p>A William White was granted 300 acres in Lower Norfolk Co. on 20 April 1682. The land was "in Knots Island, in Corretuck, being his seated plantation."[17] A William White left a will in Lower Norfolk Co. dated 21 Aug. 1683. He left to his "son Joseph White after ye decease of my wife eighty acres of land." Also mentioned were daughters Jane and Susanna.[18] By a deed dated 8 July 1703 in Princess Anne Co. a William White sold 100 acres to Patrick White out of the 300 acres patented to William White in 1683.[19] The differences in the date of the grant are evidently due to scribal error. Possibly, the William White who patented land in 1682 was the same one who left a will in 1683, and if William, Jr., were heir-at-law of William, Sr., there would be no need to mention him in the will.
<h4>The White Family of the Elizabeth River</h4>
<h4>Thomas White</h4>
<p>Thomas<sup>1</sup> White, the earliest member of the White family that settled on the Elizabeth River in Lower Norfolk Co. possibly arrived in Virginia on the ship <em>George</em> that sailed from London on 21 Aug. 1635. His age was given as 16 years.[20] Thomas White was listed as a headright on a grant to Thomas Sawyer for 250 acres on the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River in Lower Norfolk Co. on 10 March 1637/8. The other headrights listed on the patent were Christopher Hamond, Wm. Spackford, Tho: Kirke, and Isabell Ablesonne.[21] A statistical analysis of these names using the IGI showed that two of the headrights; i.e. Ablesonne and Spackford(or Spacoforth) were most likely from Yorkshire; and that Kirke was most likely from Lincolnshire with Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire next most likely.[22] The names White and Hamond are widely distributed in England. This does not prove that Thomas White was from one of these counties, and actual records of the family in England have not been found. However, there is a village in South Yorkshire, Ardsley, where there is a similarity of names to that seen in the White family of Norfolk Co., Virginia.[23]

<p>In Lower Norfolk Co. Court held on 16 June 1645 Thomas White and John Manning were ordered to pay 554 Lbs. tobacco to Arthur Browne, merchant.[24] At the same court was recorded the gift of one cow from Thomas Meares to Thomas<sup>2</sup> White the son of Thomas White and that the first calf should go to Elizabeth<sup>2</sup> White the daughter of Thomas White, and that if Thomas White the younger was to die a minor then the gift should go to the other children. Also at the same court was recorded the gift of a calf from Thomas Sayer to a daughter of Thomas Meares.[25] This gift of cattle from Thomas Sayer to the family of Thomas Meares and from Thomas Meares to the family of Thomas White shows a connection of Thomas White to the person who listed him as a headright in 1637/8.

<p>Thomas White was granted certificate for 100 acres of land on 15 Aug. 1650 in Lower Norfolk Co. court for the transport of John Biggs and George Goodman.[26] Thomas White and Peter Sexton were granted 450 acres on the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River at Gaythers Creek in Lower Norfolk Co. in March 1653.[27] By a patent, dated 15 March 1655/6, Thomas White was granted 300 acres on the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River at Julians Creek.[28] On 18 March 1662/3 Thomas White and Thomas Blanch were regranted the 450 acres on Gaythers Creek after the widow of Peter Sexton sold her part.[29] By a deed, dated 15 Aug. 1665, "Thomas White of Elizabeth River in the County of Norfolk, carpenter" sold his 300 acres on Julians Creek to John Manning.[30] On 16 Oct. 1668 Thomas White witnessed a deed of land sold by John Manning on Gathers Creek.[31]

<p>Thomas White had evidently died by 15 April 1671 when his son John<sup>2</sup> White sold 225 acres on Little Creek, i.e. half the Gaythers Creek patent, to Henry Culpepper. According to the deed, the land, adjacent to Thomas Everidge, "was in posession of my father Tho: White."[32] By a court order in Isle of Wight Co., dated 23 April 1664, "John White of the Southern Branch of Elizabeth River in the County of Lower Norfolk, yeoman" appointed Anthony Benford of Nansemond Co. attorney to demand of Paul Luke of Isle of Wight Co. three thousand pounds of tobacco due "John White in right of my wife Eady Llewellin the daughter of Thomas Llewellin formerly of the County of Isle of Wight."[33] Court records dated 9 Nov. 1664 show that John White was awarded one bed, a rug, and 1500 pounds of tobacco and cash from Paul Luke, executor of Thomas Llewellin. On 5 Jan. 1664/5 Anthony Benford released Paul Luke of all debts to John White.[34] Thomas Etheridge in his will in Lower Norfolk Co., dated 9 Nov. 1671, willed to one of his sons land by John Whytes house.[35]

<p>There are no references to John White in Lower Norfolk Co. after 1671. He was evidently not the same John White who left a will in Lower Norfolk Co. in 1680/1.[36] There are three reasons for believing that was a different John White. First, it seems that John White belonged to a different branch of the White family, second he used his own name as a headright, and lastly he seems to be older than John White of the Elizabeth River. No records were found in Virginia or North Carolina that might show John White moved from Lower Norfolk Co. around 1671. Hence, it is unclear whether John White moved from Lower Norfolk Co. around 1671, or if he continued to live there, but did not leave any records. There is a gap of 38 years in the records of the White family before John White and Luke White appear in the records of Norfolk Co. and Currituck Co., N.C., respectively, in 1709. The relationship of John White living in Lower Norfolk Co. in 1671 to the Whites who appear in the records in the eighteenth century is uncertain, however, as will be shown, there are connections that show that they were probably members of the same family.
<h4>John White</h4>
<p>1. John<sup>1 </sup>White first appeared in Norfolk Co. records when he was a witness to the will of Walter Sikes, Sr., on 15 March 1709/10.[37] The following deed records John White's first land purchase:
<blockquote>This indenture made the fourteenth day of February in the year of our Lord Seventeen Hundred and Eleven between Walter Sikes of the Southern Branch in Norfolk Co. of the one part and John White of the same branch and county of the other part. Witness that the said Walter Sikes for and in consideration of the sum of twenty five pounds doth sell unto the said John White all the land contained in the upper part of a patent granted to Walter Costing being from Joseph Curling's head line and so running the several courses of the said patent to the head thereof the quantity of one hundred and twenty two acres which land was given to the said Walter Sikes by the last will and testament of the said Costing, decd. and is situated and being in the Southern Branch in Norfolk Co. Witnesses: Lem. Wilson, Welles Wilson, Jonas Holoday, Jn. Sikes.[38]</blockquote>
<p>In Walter Costen's will in Norfolk Co., dated 7 June 1688, and proved 15 May 1694, he gave three of the sons of Walter Sikes, i.e. Walter Sikes, Jr., Thomas Sikes, and Costen Sikes equal shares of his plantation by Richford Swamp. He named Walter Sikes, Sr., his executor and called him his cousin.[39] Part of the 167 acres given to Walter Sikes, Jr., which bounded the land of Joseph Curling was evidently the land sold to John White. On 7 Oct. 1656 John Martiall sold Walter Costen 100 acres of land on the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River in Lower Norfolk Co. by Thomas Sawyer's line. The witnesses were Richard Markham, John Manning, and John Lownes.[40]

<p>Thomas Sawyer was granted 300 acres on the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River in Norfolk Co. on 22 May 1637. The headrights on the patent were his wife, Frances Sawyer, Thos.Kirke, John Sykes, Richard Gilyard, Christo. Hamon, and Wm. (S)Packford.[41] Three of these names were reused by Thomas Sawyer in his patent nearly one year later that included the headright Thomas White. A statistical analysis of the three other names seems to confirm the possibility of a Yorkshire connection of these immigrants. The name Sawyer is widely distributed in England, but the headrights Sykes and Gilyard are highly likely to have aYorkshire origin.[42] Possibly, John Sykes was the father of Walter Sikes. These two patents together show an early connection between Thomas White and the Sikes family.

<p>Another family that seems to connect John White to the earlier White family that lived on Julians and Gathers Creeks is the Taylor family. By a patent dated 6 Nov. 1665 Tho. Nash and Richard Taylor were granted 446 acres in Lower Norfolk Co. on Julians Creek.[43] This land was to the northwest of the land Thomas White sold to John Manning in 1665. They were only separated by a strip of land owned by Roger Hodges.[44] By a patent dated 15 March 1675/6 Theodor Taylor was granted 150 acres on Lower Norfolk Co. near the head of Julians Creek, "being part of a patent granted Richard Taylor and Thomas Nash 6 Nov. 1665 and due Sd. Theodor by order of the Co. Court of Lower Norfolk 17 Aug. 1669."[45] On 27 April 1686 Theodor Taylor was granted "264 acres, Lower Norfolk Co., towards head of the S. br. of the Eliz. River, by Richford Swamp."[46] Theodore Taylor sold 10 acres of the land patented in 1686 on Richford Swamp to John Nicholson on 12 May 1696.[47] On 11 May 1708 Thomas Taylor sold 64 acres in Norfolk Co. to Thomas Sikes. According to the deed he purchased the land from his brother William Taylor who was willed it by their father Theodor Taylor, dec'd. Thomas Sikes was married to his sister Mary Taylor. The deed was signed by Thomas Taylor and his wife Faith Taylor.[48]

<p>On 12 March 1716/7 Walter Curling sold 50 acres in Norfolk Co.by Richford Swamp to John White.[49 On 18 March 1717/8 John White was granted 47 acres in Norfolk Co. at the Green Sea adjacent William Taylor and John Southerland.[50] William Taylor brought suit against John White in an act of trespass in Norfolk Co. court on 18 April 1718. However, the case was continued several times before being ordered dismissed for not being prosecuted on 16 Jan. 1718/9.[51] John White witnessed the will of Robert Gamon on 14 Jan. 1718/9.[52] On 15 Nov. 1723 John White and Elizabeth, his wife, sold 50 acres on Richford Swamp adjacent to the land he purchased of Walter Sikes to James Steward for fifteen pounds. The witnesses were William Taylor, Joseph Corlene, and Charles Wodes.[53] On 20 Jan. 1724/5 John and Elizabeth White sold the 122 acres they purchased of Walter Sikes to William Sikes for thirty five pounds. The witnesses were James Stewart, Peter Taylor,and John Sikes.[54] It is believed that John White then moved from Norfolk. Co. The lists of tithables that remain for Norfolk Co. start in 1730 and do not show a John White resident in the county at that time, which seems to support the idea that he moved from the county after he sold his property in 1724/5.[55]

<p>By a patent dated 16 June 1727 John White was granted 285 acres in Isle of Wight Co. on the north side of Flatt Swamp.[56] He died by 23 March 1729/30 when his will was proved in Isle of Wight Co. court. An inventory of his estate was given by Thomas Cook, Henry Harris, and William Lee in Isle of Wight Co. court on 22 March 1730/1. It was valued at 20.11.6 pounds.[57] The following is John White's will:
<blockquote>In the name of God Amen the 23 day of January in the year of our Lord 1726 I John White of Isle of Wight County do make this my last will and testament. I give my plantation and the land of the same sides of branch that the plantation is of to my son Valentine and my wife Elizabeth during her life excepting the fifty acres John Carpenter lives upon which I give to John Carpenter and his wife during their natural life and after their decease unto their son William Carpenter. I give unto my daughter Millicent a bed . I give unto my daughter Jane 25 shillings and also to my daughter Mary 25 shillings. I give unto my son William that part of my land over the branch and if his will there live but not sell it to any person but his brothers Valentine or Jonathan.Witnesses: James Ramsay, John Carpenter, Elizabeth Redish.[58]</blockquote>
<p>In his will John White named a grandson, William Carpenter. Since the will was written in 1726, it seems probable that he was married by 1705. Also, the wills of two of his sons were recorded in 1772 and 1782, so that his children were probably born after 1695. Hence, it seems John White was probably married ca. 1695-1705. The maiden name of his wife Elizabeth is not known. The only known possibility is that she was Elizabeth Gamon. In 1725 John and Elizabeth White sold their property in Norfolk Co. The two years from that time to when the land grant in Isle of Wight Co. was recorded seems about the right amount of time to move, settle on the property, and have the grant recorded.

<p>It is not known if John White was born in Virginia, however, assuming that he was, there are two main possibilities for his parentage. Perhaps the most likely possibility is that he was the son of John<sup>2</sup> White (Thomas<sup>1</sup>), and if he was born in 1670 when the elder John White was known to be living, then he would have been 25-35 years old when he was married, and about 60 years old at the time of his death. The connections of the Costen, Sikes, and Taylor families to Thomas White and John Manning show that John White was probably related to this earlier family. It is likely that John and Eady (Llewellin) White would have had a son named John, but there is no proof that they did. Also, it is possible that John White may have moved from the county around 1671, in which case the family would have had to have moved back to Norfolk Co. at some time for him to be the father of John White, testator of Isle of Wight. The other possibility is that he was the son of Luke White of Lower Norfolk Co. As will be shown, John White and Luke White of Currituck Co. seem to belong to the same family. John White's children were probably born ca. 1700-10. Luke White's son William was born in 1710._ Also, the fact that John and Luke White first appeared in the records in 1709 would seem to show that they are about the same age. It seems possible that John and Luke White were brothers, in which case John White would probably have been the son of the elder Luke White.
The children of John and Elizabeth (___) White were:
2 i. Valentine.
ii. William.
3 iii. Jonathan.
4 iv. Elizabeth.
v. Mary.
vi. Jane.
vii. Millicent.

<p>2. Valentine<sup>2</sup> White of Isle of Wight County purchased 195 acres in Brunswick Co. from Nathaniel Barlow on 14 Feb. 1740/1.[60] It is possible that the connection with the Barlow family goes back to Norfolk Co.[61] William<sup>2</sup> White sold Valentine White 70 acres on the north side of Flat Swamp in Isle of Wight Co. on 29 July 1745.[62] This was clearly the land mentioned in John White's will. The following deed records Valentine White's sale of the land willed him by his father:
<blockquote>This indenture made this Eleventh day of April in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and fifty between Valentine White of Brunswick County and Frances Exum. Witness the said Valentine White doth grant the said Frances Exum forever all that plantation and tract of land in Southampton County containing three hundred and ninety acres on the north side of Flatt Swamp being the land and plantation where the said Valentine White formerly lived on which said land being granted to John White father of the said Valentine White by a letter patent bearing date one thousand seven hundred and twenty seven and the remainder part one hundred fifty five acres which by letters patent was granted to Valentine White. Witnesses: Thomas Clifton, Henry Rose, Joshua Claud, John Megarity, Nevit Drew.[63]</blockquote>
<p>This deed clearly shows that John and Elizabeth White's plantation was granted to John White in 1727, which is consistent with the idea that they were the same John and Elizabeth White who moved from Norfolk Co. in 1725. Valentine White was granted 746 acres in Brunswick Co. on Barlows Branch on 10 Aug. 1759.[64] Valentine White's will was dated 6 April 1778 and proved in Brunswick Co. court 27 May 1782.[65]
<p>The children of Valentine and Elizabeth (___) White were:<br>
  <div style='padding-left: 20px;'>
i. Blumer.<br>
ii. Daniel, died Brunswick Co.,Va., ca. 1795.[66]<br>
iii. (possibly) Valentine, died Granville Co., N.C., ca. 1798.[67]<br>
iv. (possibly) Samuel, died Brunswick Co., Va., ca. 1771.[68]<br>
v. Jane, married John Hamore.</div></p>

<p>3. Jonathan<sup>2</sup> White bought 308 acres of land on the Morattock (Roanoke) River in Bertie Co., N.C., from John Mackinne on 8 Feb. 1730/1.[69] On 3 Feb. 1744/5 he sold this land to John Grice.[70] By 1748 he was living in Granville Co., N.C., when he was one of three commissioners appointed by the General Assembly to choose a location for the courthouse.[71] He was also listed as a justice of the peace for Granville Co. in 1756.[72] A Granville Co. list of tithables for 1751 lists John White, Valentine White, and Jonathan White. A list of tithables for 1755 lists Jonathan White with sons William, Jonathan, and Henry.[73] He was granted land from Lord Granville in Granville Co. in 5 grants in 1754 and 1762 for 2100 acres.[74] Jonathan White's will was dated 28 Feb. 1772, and proved in Granville Co. court in Aug. 1772.[75] An account of the estate of Jonathan White, valued at 313.4.3 pounds, was rendered by Thomas Bradford, executor.[76] In his will he named his wife Sarah White. Possibly, she was the same Sarah White mentioned in Joseph Carrell's will in Isle of Wight Co., Va., dated 1 March 1733/4.[77]
<p>The children of Jonathan and Sarah (Carrell?) White were:
<div style='padding-left: 20px;'>
i. John, married Mary Bradford (b. 15 Nov. 1732)[78], died Chatham Co., N.C.,
ca. 1798.[79] The children of John and Mary (Bradford) White were:<br>
<div style='padding-left: 20px;'>
a. Sarah, born 8 May 1763.<br>
b. Lucy, born 11 March 1766.<br>
c. Philemon, born 8 July 1768.<br>
d. John, born 11 May 1770.<br>
e. Penny, born 15 July 1775.[80]<br></div>
ii. Jonathan, married Faith (Hicks?).[81]<br>
iii. William.<br>
iv. Henry, married Jemima Harris,[82] died Granville Co., N.C., ca.1776.[83]<br>
v. Burgess.<br>
vi. Philemon, died Granville Co., N.C., ca. 1803.[84]<br>
vii. Mary, married Frederick Homes.[85]</div></p>

<p>4. Elizabeth<sup>2</sup> (White) Carpenter, John Carpenter, and William<sup>3 </sup>Carpenter sold the 50 acres on Flatt Swamp in Isle of Wight Co. adjacent to Valentine White to Benjamin Hale on 22 Sept. 1743. The land was "part of a tract given them by the father of the said Carpenters wives (sic) ."[86] A John Carpenter was listed as a headright with Luke White in a patent in Lower Norfolk Co. to John Manning in 1667,[87] however there are no records of a Carpenter family living in Norfolk Co. It seems that the Carpenter family might have been from from Lancaster Co., Va., where John Carpenter and John Mott were granted 245 acres on 5 Jan. 1677/8 adjacent George Hale.[88]
<h4>Luke White</h4>
Luke<sup>1</sup> White was listed as a headright on a patent granted to John Manning for 300 acres in Norfolk Co. on Gatters Creek on 14 Sept. 1667.[89] Although no further records were located for him, he was probably the father of Luke<sup>2</sup> White who was living in Currituck Co., N.C., by 25 July 1709 when he proved the power of attorney for William Powell to Edward Poyner.[90] Luke White was granted 175 acres in Currituck Co. next to Thomas Taylor on 2 Oct. 1712.[91] Thomas Vince and Margaret his wife sold Luke White 143 acres near Poyners Point in Currituck Co. on 12 April 1714.[92]

Thomas Taylor was probably living in Currituck Co. by the late 1690s.[93] He was probably the same Thomas Taylor who was granted 1000 acres in Norfolk Co. by Richford Swamp with Thomas Edwards on 20 Oct. 1689. This land was deserted and regranted to Hugh Campbell on 26 Oct. 1694.[94] Currituck Co. records show in 1716 "one levie paid for Luke Whit by Mr. Tayler."[95] A Currituck Co. tax list from 1720 whose location was given as Currituck Shoar lists, among others, Thomas Vince, Luke White, William Nicholson, William Bell, and Thomas Taylor, Sr.[96] The facts that Thomas Taylor evidently had owned land on Richford Swamp in Norfolk. Co., and that the White, Taylor and Nicholson names occurred at both Richford Swamp and Currituck Shore seem to show a connection of these families. Also, the fact that Luke White was listed as a headright on a grant to John Manning suppports the idea that the Whites living in Norfolk and Currituck Counties in the 1700's were related to the earlier family of Thomas White. Luke White's entry on the 1720 Currituck Tax list lists one tithable and two pieces of land: one deed for 143 acres, and one patent for 170 acres. William Bell's entry on the 1720 tax list shows a tithable negro male named York.[97] This could be an indication that some of the settlers at Currituck Shore had roots in York or Yorkshire. Luke White was one of the justices of the peace appointed for Curratuck Co. on 23 March 1734/5.[98] Luke White and Margret his wife sold 213 acres by James Poyner in Currituck Co. to their son William<sup>3</sup> White on 1 Jan. 1739/40.[99] Luke White's wife Margret was the daughter of Thomas Vince as shown by his will in Currituck Co. dated 31 Aug. 1721.[100] Luke White's will was dated 8 June 1757 and proved in Currituck Co. court in March 1758. The witnesses were William Bray, Joseph Poyner, and John Wheatley.[101]
The children of Luke and Margret (Vince) White were:
i. William, born 6 July 1710, married Margrett Phillips 12 Nov. 1730, died ca. 1753.[102]
ii. Thomas, died 23 Dec. 1750.[103]
iii. Vinson.
iv. Joshua.
v.Christian
vi. Keziah, married Michael Elles.
vii. Mary, married John Tomson.
vii. Margrett.

22. IGI statistical results are as follows: Ablesonne 1600-1750 59% Yorkshire, 26 %
London; Spackford according to IGI is a variant of Spacoforth an unusual name with the
only entry being a William Spacoforth born in York, Yorkshire in 1760; Thomas Kirke
1600-1650 41% Lincolnshire, 10% Nottinghamshire, 10%Yorkshire.
23. Luke White, son of Jonathan White of Ardsley, bpt. 13 Nov. 1673 (Darfield, Yorkshire,
parish register). Will of Costyn White of Swinton (near to Ardsley), dated 6 Dec. 1557,
bequeathed to Ardesley Lane 3s 4d (Doncaster Deanery Wills, vol. 15, pt. 2, fol. 224,
Borthwick Institute, York). The name Costyn White might refer to a marriage between the
White family and the Cosin family that lived in adjcent Rawmarsh parish at that time, e.g.
Alicia and Henricus Cosin bapt. 1560. The names Costen; e.g. Walter Costen, and Costen
Sikes, Luke White, and Jonathan White all occur in the records of the White family of
Norfolk Co.

61. The Barlow family of Isle of Wight was descended from Henry Barlow of Lower
Norfolk Co. Perhaps it is coincidental, but Henry Barlow's son Thomas started appearing
in Isle of Wight Co. records in 1663, which is about the same time John White married
Eady Llewellin of Isle of Wight Co. (Lundie W. Barlow, "Barlow of Isle of Wight,
Virginia," Historical Southern Families II (Redwood City, Ca., 1958), p. 22). Nathaniel
Barlow was the son of John Barlow who left a will in Surry Co., dated 7 July 1727 (Eliza
Timberlake Davis, Wills and Administrations of Surry County, Virginia 1671-1750
(reprint; Baltimore, 1980), p. 11). Barlow does not show John Barlow as a descendant of
Henry Barlow. However, the Isle of Wight Barlow family did use the name Nathaniel.
John Barlow mentioned a John White in his will who might have been the son of Thomas
and Ann (Moore) White,and possibly the same John White who died in Isle of Wight ca.
1754 and whose estate was appraised by John Barlow, Jr. (Blanch Adams Chapman, Wills
and Administrations of Isle of Wight Co., Virginia, 1647-1800 (reprint; Baltimore, 1975),
p. 177). The Moore family was closely connected to the Barlow family in Isle of Wight
Co. Probably, John Barlow who died in Surry Co. in 1727 was related somehow to the
Isle of Wight Barlows, but the relationship is not known. On 6 Nov. 1651 the Lower
Norfolk Co. court ordered Thomas Sayer to pay Henry Barlowe 2000 lb. of tobacco
(Walter, op. cit., p. b-185). On 9 March 1652/3 Henry Barlow was granted 350 acres on
Julians Creek in Lower Norfolk Co. (Nugent , op. cit., v. 1, p. 274). These records show
that Henry Barlow probably knew Thomas White.

77. Chapman, op. cit., p. 118. In his will Joseph Carrell mentioned Sarah White, but did not
state the relationship. The Carrell family was intermarried with the Barlow family in Isle of
Wight Co. It is possible that Sarah White was the grand-daughter Sarah Carell of Sarah
Barlow who was named in her will, dated 19 March 1728/9 (Ibid., p. 107). There was
another Sarah White that lived in Isle of Wight Co. in 1733. She was the wife of Henry
White, but her maiden name was probably Baker (Ibid., p. 116).
