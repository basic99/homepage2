<h3><a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/csr/index.html/document/csr16-0699#p16-1190">Roster of the North Carolina troops in the Continental Army</a></h3>
<p>ï»¿Roster of troops shows Jno. Ward, pt., enlisted in Lytle's company, 10th regiment, in 1781, and that he was wounded. However, due to a clerical error many years past troops that did not show a regiment ended up labeled in the 10th regiment. In May 1778 the North Carolina continental line was restructured into 3 regiments merging the 1st and 6th, 2nd and 4th, and the 3rd and 5th. When Charleston fell in May 1780 the entire North Carolina line was captured, and was
<a href="http://docsouth.unc.edu/csr/index.html/document/csr15-0328">recreated</a>  in 1781. </p><p>

 Evidently he served in the militia twice for 3 months starting 8 March 1780 and for 5 months starting 10 Oct. 1780. In the summer of 1781 he enlisted in the continental line(the pension application says he joined General Sumner's regiment). According to the pension his company commander was Captain William Fawn, but the Roster of Troops shows he was in Lytle's company. The list of <a href="/graphics/3rd_regiment.png">3rd regiment officers</a>  lists Captain William Fawn and Lt. Micajah Lytle. The old 3rd regiment was commanded by General Sumner.</p>


<blockquote>
<h4>State of North Carolina<br />
Warren County</h4>

<p>Court of pleas &amp; quarter sessions Febry Term 1834. On this day 24th Febry 1834 Personally appear in open court before the justices of said court, now sitting it being a court of record, John L. Ward of the county and state aforesaid, who was born July 12th 1763, who being duly sworn according to law, doth on his oath make the following declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the provisions made by the Act of Congress passed 7th June 1832 - To Wit;</p>

<p>That he was drafted March 8th, 1780, at the house of Thomas Christmas in said county and from thence marched to Kingston, and joined Genl. William Caswells regiment, Col James Allen, Isaac Sessams, and Major Brown where he was put under the command of Capt. Tho. Christmas, Lieutenant Perkins, and Ensign Merritt, from thence we marched to West Point, from thence to Cross Creek, from thence to Chesam Hill &amp; Pee Dee River, from thence to Camden thence to McCords ferry on the Congaree, on our way to Charleston, but just before we reached Monks Corner hearing that Charleston had surrendered, we retreated towards the Santee River, crossing the said river near where Tarleton surprised Col Washington &amp; White, then up the said river to Wrights Bluff, joining on our march Col Buford with his regulars, at which place we staid several days, from thence we marched for Georgetown, and on our arriving at Cedar Creek below Nelsons Ferry on the Santee River, we were met by Genl. Davidson badly wounded, and persuaded an immediate retreat, which was done, to the high hills of Santee,</p>

<p>and from thence to Camden, near which place  a dispute between Genl. Caswell &amp; Col Buford (as I understand) and they separated, Caswell taking the right and Buford the left hand fork of the roads, soon after that took place, Tarleton came up with Buford , and cut his troops in a shocking manner, and then pursued Caswells regiment to which I belonged, which was making its way to Lenoirs Ferry on the Pee Dee River, Genl. Rutherford who had previously joined Caswells regiment, and having a fine stead horse, and fearing that Tarleton would get him, and understanding that I was a first rate rider, called for me &amp; delivered the horse to me, and said never let him be taken from me, while life lasts, but keep in the rear of the army, and watch if the enemy came in view, and immediately give information, some two or three miles before reaching the said river, being almost exhaused with fatigue, hunger &amp; thirst and seeing a little log cabin on the road side, I called for something to eat or drink, an old woman gave me a tumbler of milk, while I was drinking the milk, the horse began to prance, I looked back and saw a cloud of dust arise, I then moved with all speed, and gave information to the rear guard, that the enemy was at hand, and pushed for the river, where I saw that the army had nearly all crossed, I then forced the horse in the river, but had got very little distance from the land when the enemy came to the bank and ordered me to come back or I was a dead man, at the same time they fired so rapidly that the alarm caused me and the horse to get separated, but both landed safe and joined the retreating army on their way to Coles bridge on Drowning creek,</p>

<p>from thence to Cross Creek, and crossing over Cape Fear River, we there encamped, waiting for reinforcements, at which place Col. Seawell joined us with his troops towards the last of June, and our time of service being expired, which was for three months, Col, James Allen called on the captain to deliver up those whose time of service was out, at which time myself, Tho. Thorne, Nathan Vasser, and Wm. Medley, all in the same neighborhood were discharged, and came home, but I was soon after getting home taken with the ague and fever, but whenever I found myself able went with others in pursuit of Tories and deserters, and carrying express from and to Genl. Sumner (who lived within two miles of my father) to other officers until it was officially presented that Genl. Greene had come in the place of Genl. Gates and took the command of the Southern Army, and the greatest exertions were made to raise men, there was a call for a draft, volunteers and during the year men, among the number Capt. William Christmas turned out as volunteer captain, a Nichols as lieutenant, &amp; Fulker ensign, officers for five months from the 10th October 1780 and completed his company, of whom I was one &amp; with him or his officers was frequently in service of dangerous and fatigueing enterprises, until called into actual service by Col Eaton, who ordered Capt. Christmas to repair with his men to the south to recruit and strengthen the few remaining whigs, and cooperate with Marion, Washington, Leigh &amp; others, and being ready to join Genl. Greene in the service we experienced great hardship from almost continual traveling to day with one party, tomorrow with another, from Deep River in North Carolina to Santee in South Carolina, scarecely two days in any one section,</p>

<p> until we were called (I believe to the Waxhaws) in order to cooperate with Genl. Greene, to prevent Corn Wallace from intercepting and rescuing the prisoners that Genl. Morgan had taken at the Cowpens, at this place Christmas and his men fell under the command of Col Marbody, who continued to command until the Battle of Guilford Court House on the fifteenth of March, shortly after the battle commenced Col Marbody with a party of his horse was dispatched in order to stop the retreat of the militia, I being well acquainted with Col Washington joined his troops , and continued with him until we ran Wallace and his adherents to Ramsays Mill on Deep River, where I was taken very sick, and as I could hear no tiding of my Col, Captain, or any officer of the company, and continuing sick and an opportunity offering of my putting my horse in a waggon, I might be conveyed within two or three hundred yards of Genl. Sumners house and with two miles of my fathers, Col McDowell who I was well acquainted with gave me a furlough to Genl. Sumners, where I arrived about the middle of April 1781.</p>

<p>I heard of the safe arrival of my captain, lieutenant, and most of the men, about the first of May I went to the Shores Minerall Spring and drank freely of the water which enabled me to accompany Gen. Sumner under Capt. William Fawn, Lieutenant Yarbrough, and Ensign Tilley, to join his regiment that had previously marched to South Carolina under (I believe Col Williams) we left home about the 1st August I marched for Camden, but before we got there Genl. Greene had got the British and tories on the retreat &amp; we following on an order to overtake Genl. Greene and some other officers, which we did somewhere on the Santee River, we found Col William Henderson, who immediately took command of Capt. Fawns men, who were enlisted for six months and were fast in pursuit of the enemy and had frequent skirmishes with them, until the 8th September at Eutaw Springs, where in early part of the battle I recd. a ball in my left thigh, a buck shot in my left ancle, and another in my right leg, which bled so profusely that I was soon carried off the field and many days intervened before I knew any thing of the battle, owing to the heat and loss of blood, but being placed in kind and attentive hands I was enabled to get home a few days before Christmas, so much exhausted that it was generally believed I never should recover,</p>

<p>I continued to breath however until Aril 1782, when a company of my intimates and school fellows engaged in a privateer, and pursuaded me to accompany them as a means of restoring me to my health, which I did, on the 9th April I returned the last of June or first of July in fine health, whilst I was at sea this state was laid off in sections, and each section was to have a Capt. Lieutenant &amp; ensign and were empowered to enlist men for and during the war, Aaron Fussil, a near neighbor of mine was captain, and William Fussell Lieutenant, and myself Ensign, and our section was from Virginia line north about twenty five or thirty miles to where we lived, Halifax forty five or fifty miles, Wake court south forty five or fifty miles, Hillsborough west sixty or sixty five miles, this service commenced the 1st July 1782 in which service I sufferd more fatigue and cold than I ever experienced before or since, - sometime in February 1783 we were all dismissed as peace was concluded H.</p>
<p>this applicant hereby relinquishes any claim whatever, to a pension or annuity except the present &amp; declares that his name is not on the pension roll of the agency of any state - sworn to and subscribed the day and year aforesaid in open court.
