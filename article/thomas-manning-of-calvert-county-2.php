    <h2>Thomas Manning of Calvert County</h2>
    <p>Thomas Manning moved from Virginia to settle in Calvert County in 1658. The only useful genealogy located about this family was in <em>A</em> <em>Biographical Dictionary of the Maryland Legislature, 1635-1789</em>.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote1anc" href="#sdendnote1sym"></a><sup>1</sup></sup> However, it does not mention anything about him before 1658. Interest in the Manning family arose while researching the writer’s probable ancestor, John White, who probably moved from Lower Norfolk County, Virginia, to Maryland around 1670. The estate of “J<sup>n</sup>. White late dec<sup>d</sup> of Calvert County Carpender,” dated 10 March 1695/6, lists Thomas Manning’s son John Manning as greatest creditor at 1500 pounds of tobacco.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote2anc" href="#sdendnote2sym"></a><sup>2</sup></sup> This research was originally motivated by a search for Thomas Manning’s connections with Virginia, but eventually grew into a project of its own.

 <p>Thomas Manning lived in Nansemond County, Virginia, in the early 1650s where he was sheriff in 1657.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote3anc" href="#sdendnote3sym"></a><sup>3</sup></sup> In 1658 he moved to Calvert County, Maryland. He was appointed attorney general of Maryland on 20 Feb. 1660/1, and probably served in that office until 12 June 1666 when William Calvert was appointed to the office.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote4anc" href="#sdendnote4sym"></a><sup>4</sup></sup> Since he served as attorney general it appeared to be a good possibility that he received some formal education, probably at either Oxford or Cambridge. A check of the matriculation records showed the most likely candidate was Thomas Manning of Norwich who received his BA from Cambridge in 1643-4. The rent rolls of Talbot County, Maryland, show that Thomas Manning and John Ingram were owners of a tract of land named <em>Norwich</em> surveyed 17 July 1664.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote5anc" href="#sdendnote5sym"></a><sup>5</sup></sup> This coincidence of the entry in <em>Alumni Cantabrigienses</em> and the name of the tract of land led to the conclusion that possibly Thomas Manning was born in Norwich. Research conducted in Norfolk found records that are consistent with this conclusion, and yielded a fair amount information about his family.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote6anc" href="#sdendnote6sym"></a><sup>6</sup></sup> Of particular interest is the will of his mother Hester Manning. Since there are a number of records that indicate Thomas Manning might have been born in Norwich, and not any contradictory evidence, then it is assumed from here that he was born in Norwich, although there are no records that prove this fact conclusively. This genealogy starts with John Manning of Norwich, scrivener, the probable father of Thomas Manning of Maryland.

&nbsp;

 <p>1. John<sup>A </sup>Manning, scrivener, was admitted a freeman of the city of Norwich on 15 Sept. 1615. Scriveners were writers of court documents. He had been an apprentice of Robert Debney, alderman of Norwich.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote7anc" href="#sdendnote7sym"></a><sup>7</sup></sup> Possibly he was the same John Manning who was baptized 26 October 1588 at Norwich, St Gregory.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote8anc" href="#sdendnote8sym"></a><sup>8</sup></sup> The will of Robert Debney, dated 29 August 1634, mentioned John Manning of Norwich, scrivener, and called him his nephew.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote9anc" href="#sdendnote9sym"></a><sup>9</sup></sup> The will also made individual bequests of five pounds to John Manning’s children Robert, John, Thomas, Phillipp, Elizabeth, Nathaniel, and Richard.

 <p>John Manning was married to Hester Andrews on 13 May 1616 at Saint Stephen Parish, Norwich.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote10anc" href="#sdendnote10sym"></a><sup>10</sup></sup> He was probably the John Manning who served as under sheriff of Norwich in 1618, 1624, 1633, and 1638. He died by 16 Oct. 1646 when administration of his estate was granted to his brother-in-law John Forth, Clerk, a creditor.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote11anc" href="#sdendnote11sym"></a><sup>11</sup></sup>

 <p>His wife, Hester (Andrews) Manning, outlived him and was buried at Norwich, Saint Andrew, on 20 April 1657.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote12anc" href="#sdendnote12sym"></a><sup>12</sup></sup> A partial transcription of the will of Hester Manning Widow, proved 10 March 1657/8, follows:
<blockquote>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"></p>
<p class="quote">The two and twentieth day of Aprill in the yeare of our Lord God One thousand six hundred fifty and six I Hester Manning of the Citty of Norwich widdow … dow constiture ordaine and make Phillipp Manning my sonn &amp; Elizabeth Manning my daughter my joynt and onlie Executors of this my last will and testament Item I dow give and bequeath unto Richard Manning my sonne my best diamond ring which was my mothers Mris Katherine Andrews deceased and six of my best plain pockett handkerchiefs <em>to be delivered unto him by my executors mediately after my decease</em> and also I do give and bequeath unto the said Richard Manning my sonne the sum of threescore pounds of good &amp; lawfull money of England to be paid unto him by my executors in manner and form following (that is to saie) thirty pounds therof within one yeare after my decease and the other thirty pounds therof within the other year then next following or otherwise that said legacie of threescore pounds<em> do be sent unto him at the tyme aforesaid in full value of such goods wares or commiditues as he by his letter under his hand shall write for unto my said executors and desire to have in him thereof with his discharge in writinge under his hand and seale of and for the same</em>…I doe give unto my sonne Thomas Manning one of my Jemm Gold ringes which was my mother Andrews deceased, and six of my pockett handkerchiefs and I give unto my daughter in law his wife my other Jemm gold ring<em> to be delivered or carefully sent unto them by my executors mediately or as soon as may be after my decease</em> …Also I doe give &amp; bequeath unto John Manning my grandchild sonn of Thomas Manning my sonn the sum of five pounds of like money to be paid unto him at his age of fifteen years by my executors if he shall dye before that age then the same shall be paid to his brothers and sisters of his whole blood my grandchildren if any there be … I have sett my hand and seale the day and yeare first herein before written By me Hester Manninge Sealed published and acknowledged by the Testatrix to be her last will and testament in the presence of us- William Dallison, Samuel Bolten, and me John Mathewe.<sup> <a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote13anc" href="#sdendnote13sym"></a><sup>13</sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5in;">There are three pieces of information in the will that can be verified about the Manning family in Virginia and Maryland. The wording of the will implies that two of Hester Manning’s sons, i.e. Richard and Thomas, were probably living abroad in 1656. Also, Thomas Manning was married and he had a son John who was under 15. These facts will be shown to fit with the known facts. Also, Thomas Manning of Maryland named his sons in his will John, Thomas, and Nathaniel. John Manning of Norwich, scrivener, also named sons John, Thomas, and Nathaniel. Unfortunately, Hester Manning did not name her daughter-in-law, wife of Thomas Manning, which would have been a better proof.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5in;">Hester (Andrews) Manning’s mother Katherine Andrews also left a will. The will of “Katherine Andrews of the Citty of Norwich Widdow” was dated 4 Oct. 1635 and recorded in 1639. The primary beneficiaries of the will were her daughters “Suzan the wife of John Forth of Swainthorpe in Norfolk Clarke,” and “Hester the wife of John Manning of Norwich Scrivener.”<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote14anc" href="#sdendnote14sym"></a><sup>14</sup></sup></p>

 <p>3. John<sup>1</sup> Manning (John<sup>A</sup>) matriculated a pensioner at Corpus Christi ,Cambridge, at the Michaelmas term1637. He received his BA in 1641 and an MA in 1647.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote20anc" href="#sdendnote20sym"></a><sup>20</sup></sup> The will of Katherine Andrews has a codicil that reads “5 May 1638 unto her grandchild John Manning eight pounds to buy him books within 2 years after her decease.” He was ordained deacon at Norwich 24 Sept. 1643. His ordination record confirms his Bachelor of Arts from Corpus Christi, Cambridge and it also says that he was 22 and born in the parish of St Andrew, Norwich.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote21anc" href="#sdendnote21sym"></a><sup>21</sup></sup> It appears from his baptismal record that his age should be 21, but it is clearly the same person. He died in 1649 and was buried at Saint Andrew, his entry in the register reading “ John Manning the sonne of Ester Manning buried April 18.”<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote22anc" href="#sdendnote22sym"></a><sup>22</sup></sup>

&nbsp;

 <p>4. Thomas<sup>1</sup> Manning (John<sup>A</sup>) was admitted sizar at age 15 to Peterhouse, Cambridge, on 26 June 1640. His matriculation record states he was of Norwich. He migrated to Corpus Christi, the same college as his brother, and received his BA in 1643 4.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote23anc" href="#sdendnote23sym"></a><sup>23</sup></sup>

 <p>He was in Virginia by 1651 when he was granted 150 acres in Warwick County, Virginia, along the river to Thomas Davis.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote24anc" href="#sdendnote24sym"></a><sup>24</sup></sup> The headrights for Thomas Manning, transported twice, were used by assignment from Thomas Manning for a patent to Thomas Brereton dated 8 Oct. 1657.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote25anc" href="#sdendnote25sym"></a><sup>25</sup></sup> Also on this list of headrights of 20 persons were Henry Bastard and Henry Alexander who appear later in records with Thomas Manning. Thomas Brereton was clerk for the Council of Virginia from 1654-61, and married after 10 Feb. 1657/8 Jane Claiborne.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote26anc" href="#sdendnote26sym"></a><sup>26</sup></sup> Possibly, he was a member of the Norwich branch of the Brereton family.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote27anc" href="#sdendnote27sym"></a><sup>27</sup></sup> If so then he was a close relative of Rev. John Brereton of Norwich who sailed to America in 1602 and wrote <em>A Brief and True Relation of the Discoverie of the North Part of Virginia</em>.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote28anc" href="#sdendnote28sym"></a><sup>28</sup></sup> The fact that Col. Thomas Pettus of Norwich was on the Council may explain how he got the position of clerk.

 <p>A bond of “John Maning of Norwich in the County of Northfolk in England Merchant” to “Richard Cooke and Daniell Hoare both of Boston in New England Merchts” for the payment of 20 thousand 500 pounds of tobacco at the dwelling house of Lawrence Wards in Nansemond, Virginia, was signed 12 Oct. 1653.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote29anc" href="#sdendnote29sym"></a><sup>29</sup></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote30anc" href="#sdendnote30sym"></a><sup>30</sup></sup> On the previous day, 11 Oct. 1653, Edward Gibbons of Boston appointed Daniel Hoare of London, merchant, to be his lawful attorney to recover any debts in Virginia or Maryland.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote31anc" href="#sdendnote31sym"></a><sup>31</sup></sup> On 6 Feb. 1653/4 Daniel Hoare acknowledged receipt of 1760 pounds of tobacco from Mr. Thomas Hatton, secretary of Maryland, for Major Edward Gibbons. The witnesses were Henry Coursey, James Veitch, and Thomas Marsh.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote32anc" href="#sdendnote32sym"></a><sup>32</sup></sup> On 24 April 1655 Richard Collett was banished from the colony of Maryland on account of a petition he had signed. However, he was to give notice to Lawrence Ward of Virginia whose plantation he managed in Patuxent River (original name for Calvert County) before leaving.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote33anc" href="#sdendnote33sym"></a><sup>33</sup></sup> The fact that he was from Norwich, and his merchant connections with Lawrence Ward of Nansemond and Calvert County, and with Thomas Marsh (see below) indicate that John Manning was probably a relative of Thomas Manning. However, as was already shown, Thomas Manning’s brother John and father John were already dead by 1653. Also, a search of Norwich parish registers for this John Manning failed to find anything. Therefore, although this record is further proof that Thomas Manning was born in Norwich, his exact relationship to John Manning the merchant is unknown.

 <p>In Lower Norfolk, Virginia, court held on 18 April 1654 Thomas Manning, gent., was attorney for Seger de Ham for a debt of 1336 pounds tobacco which was assigned from John Taylor to Henry Bastard, merchant.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote34anc" href="#sdendnote34sym"></a><sup>34</sup></sup> The records of the High Court of Admiralty contain depositions concerning the case of John Wilson &amp; Abraham Read v. Nathaniel Jesson, dated 25 July 1652 to 2 Dec. 1653.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote35anc" href="#sdendnote35sym"></a><sup>35</sup></sup> On 7 Feb. 1651/2 the <em>Golden Lion</em>, which sailed from Amsterdam in August 1651, was seized in the James River by 3 English ships. The principals in this suit were the captains of the 3 English ships. Several planters from Virginia who loaded tobacco onto the <em>Golden Lion</em> initially brought the suit. A number of passengers and merchants shipping on the <em>Golden Lion</em> were described as “well affected to the Parliament.” The deposition of Seger de Hem of London states that he was brother of James de Hem, an Englishman born in Norwich, who lived in Holland and that he sent a shipment of timber to his factor in Virginia, John Brown, in order to build a sloop. The deposition of Benjamin Osborne further states that in 1649 the <em>Golden Lion</em> belonged to James de Hem and Richard Ford, and James had a brother Tobias de Ham who was also born in Norwich. Whether the court order in Lower Norfolk was a direct result of the case in Admiralty Court is unclear. However, it is clear Thomas Manning was acting as attorney for the interests of the de Ham family of Norwich. Further, from this case we can possibly infer that he was sympathetic to the cause of Parliament.
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On 15 Oct. 1655 Elizabeth Lloyd of Elizabeth River administratrix of Lt. Col. Cornelius Lloyd sold a mare and foal and some cattle to Thomas Manning. Thomas Manning of Nansemond, merchant, by his bill of the same date agreed to pay to Elizabeth Lloyd four thousand eight hundred pounds of tobacco and cask.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote36anc" href="#sdendnote36sym"></a><sup>36</sup></sup> The administration of the estate of Cornelius Lloyd included debts to Mr. Manning.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote37anc" href="#sdendnote37sym"></a><sup>37</sup></sup> In Lower Norfolk court held on 15 May 1656 an order was granted for payment to Thomas Manning of 5,700 pounds of tobacco and cask, part of which Mr. Manning intended to have paid to John Smith of Warwick River by Thomas Davis.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote38anc" href="#sdendnote38sym"></a><sup>38</sup></sup> On 8 June 1657 Thomas Manning was appointed sheriff of Nansemond by the General Court of Virginia.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote39anc" href="#sdendnote39sym"></a><sup>39</sup></sup></p>
 <p>Thomas Manning and his family moved to Maryland in 1658, when he demanded land for transporting 12 persons; i.e., Henry Alexander, William MacDowell, Mary Broder, James Elton, Thomas Manning , Grace Manning, John Manning, Thomas Manning, Hannah Meers, Francis Bennett, Sarah Featly, and P: S: Franks.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote40anc" href="#sdendnote40sym"></a><sup>40</sup></sup> The fact that Thomas Manning of Virginia and Maryland were the same person is evident from a statement of Philip Calvert, dated 1 Feb. 1663/4, which he made about the “Sale of a Certaine Tract of Land Lying uppon the Cliffts in Caluert County from Thomas Marsh late of Elizabeth Riuer in Virginia, unto Thomas Manning of Nansemund.”<sup> <a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote41anc" href="#sdendnote41sym"></a><sup>41</sup></sup> The grant was that dated 6 April 1661 called <em>Thepbush Manning</em> granted to Thomas Manning and Edward Darcy, assignees of Thomas Marsh.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote42anc" href="#sdendnote42sym"></a><sup>42</sup></sup> A patent to Thomas Manning for 300 acres, dated 3 Sept. 1663, called <em>The Goare</em> in Calvert County was adjacent to this patent and a patent to Richard Bennett called <em>Lower Bennett</em>.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote43anc" href="#sdendnote43sym"></a><sup>43</sup></sup> Aside from these patents in Calvert County he had 9 other land grants in Talbot and Dorchester Counties, dated between 1659 and 1664. He also had a grant of 800 acres called <em>Mannings Resolution</em> in Somerset County, dated 1663, which he left in his will to sons Thomas and Nathaniel.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote44anc" href="#sdendnote44sym"></a><sup>44</sup></sup>

 <p>In addition to serving as attorney general of Maryland, Thomas Mannnig was in the Lower House representing Calvert County in 1661, 1662, and 1669 and was speaker in 1669. He was justice for Calvert County from 1661-1667 and captain in the militia.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote45anc" href="#sdendnote45sym"></a><sup>45</sup></sup> An inventory of the estate of Thomas Manning was taken 8 March 1670/1. His library in the lodging chamber consisted of 8 religious books plus several old books in French Dutch and Latin. The books in the studio numbered 17 plus several other old books, and included several law books including Dalton’s <em>Justice of Peace</em> and an <em>Abridgement of Sir Edward Coke</em>.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote46anc" href="#sdendnote46sym"></a><sup>46</sup></sup> It appears that he was a learned man, which is consistent with the original theory that he attended a university. A transcription of the will of Thomas Manning follows:

&nbsp;
<blockquote>

7. Richard<sup>1</sup> Manning (John<sup>A</sup>) was probably living abroad in 1656 when his mother made her will, and the following record shows that he was probably in Maryland. At Maryland Provincial court held 17 August 1659 the following was recorded:

&nbsp;
<p class="quote">Thomas Manning Recordeth these Cattle for his sonne John Manning, being gyuen him the sd John, by his Vncle Richard Manning (Viz) One Browne Cow called Star-buck, One yeareling heifer, &amp; one Steare Calfe, marked, The Left eare Cropt, &amp; a slitt in the Crop, The Right eare ouerhald.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote48anc" href="#sdendnote48sym"></a><sup>48</sup></sup></p>
Although there is room for interpretation, it appears that Richard Manning was living in Maryland in 1659, possibly in Calvert County. No further information has been found about him.

&nbsp;

 <p>9. John<sup>2</sup> Manning (Thomas<sup>1</sup>, John<sup>A</sup>) was the oldest son and heir of Thomas Manning. He was sued in Maryland Provincial Court as son and heir of Thomas Manning for a debt to Robert Carvile. John Manning, by his guardian Richard Smith, pleaded he was not yet 21 years of age and not required to pay. The court ruled on 10 Feb. 1674/5 that he pay the debt when he said nothing in his defense.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote49anc" href="#sdendnote49sym"></a><sup>49</sup></sup> Since he was probably just turned 21 in 1674, then his birth date was approximately 1653. This date gives agreement with the third point in the will of Hester Manning.

 <p>In 1689 John Manning and Nathaniel Manning were among those “loyall Protestant Subjects Inhabitants in Calvert County “ who signed a petition and oath of loyalty to William and Mary.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote50anc" href="#sdendnote50sym"></a><sup>50</sup></sup> On 7 Feb. 1692/3 the newly appointed vestrymen of Christ Church in Calvert County were Mr Richard Smith, Capt Thomas Clagget, Mr Henry Fernley, Mr Francis Maiden, Mr John Manning, and Mr Saml Holdsworth.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote51anc" href="#sdendnote51sym"></a><sup>51</sup></sup>

 <p>John Manning and his wife Sarah sold part of <em>Mannings Resolution</em> containing about 100 acres to Cornelius Johnson of Somerset County on 16 Jan. 1676/7.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote52anc" href="#sdendnote52sym"></a><sup>52</sup></sup> Nathaniel Manning of Calvert County sold what was evidently the other part of <em>Mannings Resolution</em> to Cornelius Johnson on 16 Dec. 1684.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote53anc" href="#sdendnote53sym"></a><sup>53</sup></sup> Since Thomas Manning in his will left this property to his sons Thomas and Nathaniel, then it appears that Thomas died by 16 Jan. 1676/7 and his part went to his two brothers. John Manning’s first wife, Sarah, was probably the mother of Thomas, John, Gregory, and Grace. He married second, between 1 Jan. 1697/8 and May 12 1699, Ruth, the widow of Hugh Ellis of Calvert County.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote54anc" href="#sdendnote54sym"></a><sup>54</sup></sup> John Manning was dead by 29 July 1700 when an inventory of his estate was returned.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote55anc" href="#sdendnote55sym"></a><sup>55</sup></sup> The account of Ruth and Thomas Manning, executors of John Manning of Calvert County was entered 8 Aug. 1703.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote56anc" href="#sdendnote56sym"></a><sup>56</sup></sup> His will was dated 4 May 1700 and recorded 13 Jan. 1724.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote57anc" href="#sdendnote57sym"></a><sup>57</sup></sup>

&nbsp;

 <p>11. Nathaniel<sup>2</sup> Manning (Thomas<sup>1</sup>, John<sup>A</sup>) was the father of Richard Manning who deposed on 22 Feb. 1736/7 that he was the son and heir of Nathaniel Manning who died on 7 May 1731.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" name="sdendnote58anc" href="#sdendnote58sym"></a><sup>58</sup></sup>

<a class="sdendnotesym" name="sdendnote2sym" href="#sdendnote2anc"></a>2 Perogative Court of Maryland, Inventories and Accounts, liber 13b, f. 54, FHL Film #12921. In a previous article about the White family<em> </em>I noted that John<sup>2</sup> White (Thomas<sup>1</sup>) seemed to leave Lower Norfolk County, Virginia, around 1671 (James Bruce White, ”The White Family of Norfolk County, Virginia,” <em>The Virginia Genealogist</em> 42<em> </em>[January-March 1998] , pp. 29-43). It is possible that he was the same person who died in Calvert County in 1695.
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“Thomas White the elder aged fifty eight” made a deposition in Lower Norfolk court on 15 July 1657 concerning a dispute between his son Thomas and Walter Costin and John Manning (Lower Norfolk Wills &amp; Deeds D, p. 84). If he gave the correct age in this deposition, then he was not the same Thomas White who was transported in the George in 1635 and whose age was given as 16 years as I suggested in my previous article.Thomas<sup>1</sup> White, Sr., died in Lower Norfolk County by 16 Feb. 1665/6 when administration of his estate was granted to his widow (Lower Norfolk Wills &amp; Deeds D, f. 435). John<sup>2</sup> White was probably the same who appeared on a list of headrights in Maryland granted to Richard Holland for transport “into this pvince to Inhabit Anno 1669” (Maryland Patents Liber 18, f. 17). This date is consistent with Lower Norfolk County records that show he was not in the county in 1669 (Lower Norfolk Wills &amp; Deeds E, court orders, f. 44, 44a, 47). John<sup>2</sup> White's older brother Thomas<sup>2</sup> White died by 15 Aug. 1670 (Lower Norfolk Wills &amp; Deeds E, court orders, f. 50a.). The identification of which of the two Thomas Whites who died in Lower Norfolk County was father or son is probable. John<sup>2</sup> White returned to Lower Norfolk County by 4 Nov 1670 when he appeared in Lower Norfolk Court (Lower Norfolk Wills &amp; Deeds E, court orders, f. 53a, 55). He evidently returned to settle his affairs, as he was heir after his probable older brother died. He stayed in Lower Norfolk county until 14 June 1671 when he signed a power of attorney to Bartholomew Ingelbretson (Lower Norfolk Wills &amp; Deeds E, p. 97 ), after which time it is presumed he returned to Maryland. Interestingly, Bartholomew Ingelbretson moved with his family to Ann Arundell County by 29 July 1673 (Maryland Patents, lib. 17, f. 478).</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Possibly John<sup>3</sup> White (John<sup>2</sup>, Thomas<sup>1</sup>) was born in Calvert County Maryland. On 15 March 1709/10 John<sup>3</sup> White was in Norfolk County Court and was granted a headright certificate for 50 acres for his own importation (Norfolk County Deed Book 8, p. 141). This is consistent with his being born in Maryland and moving to Norfolk County as a young man. In conclusion it is therefore likely that John White who lived on the Elizabeth River in Norfolk County until 1724 was the grandson of Thomas White who lived there until he died in Lower Norfolk County in 1665.</p>

<p class="sdendnote-western"><a class="sdendnotesym" name="sdendnote27sym" href="#sdendnote27anc"></a>27 It is possible that Thomas Brereton was the son of William Brereton, baptized 12 Oct. 1630 at Caister near Norwich (IGI). The will of William Brereton of Caster next Norwich was dated 24 Oct. 1656 (PCC will, Prob/11/261). He mentioned land he had of John Debney (possibly the son of Robert Debney). He gave his son Thomas Brereton 150 pounds to be paid upon the end or termination of the lease he had of Sir Thomas Pettus. The wording of this bequest also implied that Thomas Brereton did not yet have any heirs. This connection with the Pettus family and his apparent lack of heirs in 1656 appears to match Thomas Brereton of Virginia.</p>

<a class="sdendnotesym" name="sdendnote30sym" href="#sdendnote30anc"></a>30 In 1650 John Manning of Boston made Richard Cooke his attorney to pay 300 pounds to Wm. Peake and Daniel Hoare of London (Early History of Boston containing Aspinwall Notorial Records from 1644 to 1651[Boston, 1903], pp. 307-8). Since these were the same people involved in his bond of 1653, then John Manning of Norwich was probably the same as John Manning , merchant, living in Boston in 1650. It is possible that John Manning of Norwich was the same whose biography was given in Appletons’: “He is thought to by some to be the same Capt. John Manning who was in Boston about 1650 and to have been of the family of William Manning, merchant, of Cambridge and Boston. His employment in New York came through the recommendation of Samuel Maverick, who, in a letter of 16 Sept. 1663 … He enjoyed the confidence of Gov. Lovelace, served as a member of his council, and when the governor was called to any distance from the city, Fort James and public affairs were placed in Manning’s charge. While he was thus in command, in 1673, the Dutch fleet arrived and demanded surrender of the fort, which, after some resistance, was given up. He sailed for England, waited on the king and Duke of York, and explained to them the particulars of the surrender, on hearing which the king turned to the duke and said: ‘Brother, the ground could not be maintained with so few men.’ He returned to New York with Gov. Andros, and was soon afterward tried by court-martial on charges of treachery and cowardice. He was acquitted of the former, but found guilty of cowardice, and on 5 Feb. 1675, sentenced to have his sword broken over his head and rendered incapable of again holding office…” (Wilson and Fiske, editors, Appletons’ Cyclopedia of American Biography[New York, 1888], v. 4, pp. 192-3).

William Manning mentioned as a possible relative above left a will in Boston in 1665 in which he mentioned a son William, but no son John, and was probably not the father of John Manning (New England Historical Register, v. 15, p. 123). Records of the Maverick family show that a John Manning was married to Abigail Maverick, sister of Samuel Maverick, before 1643 (William Greenlaw, “John Maverick and Some of His Descendants,” New England Historical Register, v. 96, p. 234). If this was the same John Manning, then he had been living in Boston for over 10 years when he was called John Manning of Norwich in 1653.

In 1646 John Manning of Boston merchant gave a power of attorney to Isaac Allerton of New Haven to recover debts of Thomas Bushrode in Virginia (Aspinwall Notorial Records, p. 31). In 1649 John Manning of Boston gave power of attorney to James Neale of Fayal to recover debts of Thomas Bushrode (Aspinwall Notorial Records, p. 242). On 26 April 1654 Capt. John Manning was in New Haven General Court concerning trading with the Dutch in Manhattan (spelled as Munnadoes or Manhatoes). Captain Manning admitted trading recently with the Dutch in Manhattan and also trading in Virginia. A Mr. Ludlow (probably George Ludlow of York County, Virginia) came and said that Capt. Manning was engaged to transport him and his family to Virginia, and tried to post bond to allow the ship to transport him to Virginia. Finally, the ship was seized and ordered sold at auction (Charles Hoadley, Records of the Colony of New Haven from May 1653, [Hartford, 1858], pp. 68-75). It is not certain that all these records refer to the same person, however it is possible that they do. If that is the case then John Manning of Norwich was in Boston before 1643 when he was married to Abigail Maverick, and he was a prominent merchant who carried on trade in Virginia, a captain who traded with Virginia and the Dutch in Manhattan, and possibly was in charge of New York when it surrendered to the Dutch in 1673.

The possible connection of John White, carpenter of Calvert County, to Lower Norfolk County, Virginia, is apparent from the fact of Thomas Manning’s connections to Lower Norfolk County, and also those of Thomas Marsh. Although the original grant or deed was not located there are several land grants in Lower Norfolk County on Gaithers Creek, a branch of the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, that state they are adjacent to the land of Thomas Marsh (Nugent, v.1, pp. 174, 179, 445, 497). On 25 Oct. 1648 John Manning of Lower Norfolk County (died ca. 1670) was granted 200 acres on Gaither’s Creek (Nugent, v. 1, p. 180). Possibly he was a relative of Thomas Manning, although proof is lacking. On 31 March 1653 Thomas<sup>1</sup> White and Peter Sexton were granted 450 acres on Gaither’s Creek (Nugent, v. 1, p. 247).
