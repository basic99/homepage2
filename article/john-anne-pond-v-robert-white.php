    <h2>John & Anne Pond V Robert White</h2>

    <p>This is the chancery case concerning the estate of the grandfather of Ralph White, grocer of Stepney. The records for a chancery case consist of a complaint and a response. Each is written on one or more very wide documents which makes them time consuming to transcribe. The record I transcribed here is the complaint.
